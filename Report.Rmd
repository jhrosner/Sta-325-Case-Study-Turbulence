## Introduction
Our goals are as follows: For a new parameter setting of (Re, F r, St), predict its particle cluster volume distribution in terms of its four raw moments. Inference: Investigate and interpret how each parameter affects the probability distribution for particle cluster volumes.

## Methodology
##### Linear Modeling
Our univariate exploratory data analysis of Re, Fr, St, and each moment revealed that the R moments are heavily right skewed, which poses a problem to linear regression. We applied log transformations on each moment to obtain more normally distributed variables. The log-transformed R moments are approximately normal, and it appears that each R moment variable has somewhat of a linear relationship with St.

Accordingly, we fit a basic linear model onto each log-transformed response variable. Linear models were evaluated based on adjusted R^2 values and Pr(>|t-value|) for coefficient estimates. We chose to treat Re and Fr as factors or categorical variables, as Re only takes on the values of 90, 224, and 398; Fr only takes on the values 0.052, 0.3, and infinity. While the adjusted R^2 value for R_moment_1 was very high at 0.9949, subsequent moments exhibited decreasing adjusted R^2 values, with R_moment_4 having an adjusted R^2 value of 0.6518.We explored multicollinearity through VIFs for each model, which were very low. We also explored the addition of interaction terms to the model. The only interaction term which was significant for all R_moments was the interaction between Re and Fr. St and Re only have significant interaction for the first moment. Therefore, we constructed the linear models with an interaction between Re and Fr:
$$ log(R_{moment1})=-2.73+0.25(st)-3.816(Re_{224})-5.988(Re_{398})-0.263(Fr_{0.3})-.329(Fr_{\infty})+0.221(Re_{224}*Fr_{0.3})+0.402(Re_{224}*Fr_{\infty})+0.502(Re_{398}*Fr_{\infty})\\
log(R_{moment2})=5.187$$

Adding the interaction term between Re and Fr improved the fit of the model according to the adjusted R^2 values, which are much higher for every moment. With this new interaction term included, the adjusted R^2 value for R_moment_1 was slightly higher than before at 0.9966, and increased for moment 2 at 0.8909, moment 3 at 0.8770, and moment 4 0.8809 respectively.
